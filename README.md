# ClojureInterview
checkBrackets.clj is the program to evaluate if parenthesis in input sting are balanced.

To run the program I have created clojure running configuration in REPL, and to check
if specific String is valid the function that is defined in program should be called in 
REPL console. ex. (firstCheck), (secondCheck) etc.
